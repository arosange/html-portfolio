<h1> CPR Training</h1>
<p> The CPR Training Session is a course by Rose that all the office workers have to take, since nobody knew how to save Stanley Hudson after he collapsed of a heart attack earlier</p>

<h2> What you will learn?</h2>
<p>You will learn the most up-to-date guidelines for performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation or CPR. Your course will teach you the proper way to perform CPR skills such as chest compressions and rescue breathing. Depending on the course, you may learn how to perform adult, child, and infant CPR, or focus specifically on adult CPR.
Your class will cover the basic anatomy and physiology of the respiratory and cardiac systems, and how your intervention can work to support them.
    Periodically, the American Heart Association updates its CPR guidelines, so it is always important to keep your certification fresh.</p>
